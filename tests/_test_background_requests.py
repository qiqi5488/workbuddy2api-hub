"""The background-request filter must not swallow a request the user asked for.

The filter matches a keyword against request_kind / turn_trigger /
thread_source, and the user's own "compact the context" request carries
request_kind=compaction - the same word as the background keyword. Once the
filter was switched on, pressing that button returned the refusal instead of a
summary. The two requests are told apart by the thread they run on: the
compaction the client starts by itself names the job that started it
(thread_source=memory_consolidation), while the operator's compaction runs on
the user's thread.

thread_source=user is not a general "the user asked for this" marker - an
auto_review the client fires on the user's thread carries it too, which is why
the exemption is scoped to request_kind=compaction instead of to the thread.

These cases pin that distinction, both shapes the metadata arrives in, and the
background jobs the filter exists for. No network access required.
