"""Run every bundled suite and print one line per file.

Python suites run under the current interpreter; the JS suites need `node` on
PATH and are reported as skipped when it is missing. `_mobile_check.py` is not
part of this set: it drives the dashboard with Playwright/Firefox and is run by
hand.

Each suite's output goes to a file rather than a pipe, so a suite that spawns the
gateway still sees a normal console.

Two things the runner is responsible for, because a suite cannot be:

  - bounding a suite. Several of them start the gateway and wait on it; a hang
    used to hold the whole job until its own timeout, so every suite now has a
    wall clock and is killed - together with anything it started - when it runs
    out.
  - saying what went wrong. The last line of a crashed JS suite is a bare
    "Node.js v20.20.2", so a failure line carries the first error instead, and
    `--logs` keeps every suite's full output for the CI artifact.
