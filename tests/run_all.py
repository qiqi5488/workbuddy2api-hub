Python suites run under the current interpreter; the JS suites need `node` on
PATH and are reported as skipped when it is missing. `_mobile_check.py` is not
part of this set: it drives the dashboard with Playwright/Firefox and is run by
hand.

Each suite's output goes to a temporary file rather than a pipe, so a suite that
spawns the gateway still sees a normal console and a failure can be shown with
its tail.
