"""A rejected request must not desynchronise a keep-alive connection.

An early rejection (401, 429, 404) used to reply without reading the request
body, so the payload stayed in the socket. The next request on that connection
then parsed the leftover JSON as its request line and failed - surfacing as a
bogus "414 Request-URI Too Long" with an empty request line in the log, on an
otherwise healthy connection.

Any client using a connection pool hits this as "random" failures that
disappear on retry, which is why it is worth a standing test. A raw socket is
required: an HTTP client library would silently open a fresh connection and
hide the bug entirely.

Each response is read up to its own boundary instead of being waited for with a
fixed sleep, so the suite synchronizes on the server's answer rather than on
machine speed: a correct server on a busy runner used to answer after the sleep
had already expired, which is indistinguishable from the regression under test.

Starts a real server on a spare port with a throwaway store, so it needs no
network access and does not touch the real accounts.
