"""Contract tests for tests/run_all.py - the runner's reliability promises.

run_all.py owns behavior no single suite can check for itself: a per-suite wall
clock, tree cleanup when that clock runs out, a failure line that names the real
error instead of a bare "Node.js v20.20.2", log retention, argument validation,
and "a pattern that matches nothing is not a pass". Today only the console
encoding failure mode has dedicated coverage (_test_run_all_encoding.py), so
every other promise rests on the full CI matrix noticing indirectly.

These tests drive the real runner as a subprocess against throwaway probe
suites, so each contract is exercised end to end. Nothing is mocked: the failing
probe really exits non-zero, and the hanging probe really has to be killed.

Isolation: the runner discovers suites next to itself (os.listdir(HERE)), so a
byte-identical copy of run_all.py is placed in a temporary directory with the
probe suites beside it. Nothing is ever written into the repository's tests/
directory, and the copy is compared against the real file first, so these tests
cannot silently drift away from the code they cover.

Cleanup never asks the code under test for help. The thing under test is exactly
what may be broken, so the harness starts every sandbox runner in a group it
owns, keeps the pids it may have to kill outside the disposable scenario
directory, and terminates the whole tree through the OS (TerminateProcess /
SIGKILL) rather than through taskkill - a locked-down host refuses that just as
readily as it refuses the runner's own call.

Run with: python tests/_test_run_all_contracts.py
No network, no credentials. Every probe file, process and log directory this
suite creates is removed in a finally block.
