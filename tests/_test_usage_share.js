/* Pin what the analytics matrix's 用量占比 column is a share *of*, and which
 * row each share belongs to.
 *
 * The column used to divide every row by the largest row, so the biggest
 * model always read 100% and everything else was a fraction of it - a
 * relative ranking wearing the label of a share. The contract asserted here
 * is the plain one: each row's own tokens over the total in the summary row,
 * which is also the number the table itself prints as the total.
 *
 * The shares are read per row, keyed by the model that row is about, instead
 * of as an array of cells in render order. The array proved the numbers were
 * present in that sequence and nothing more: swap two model labels and it is
 * unchanged, so a row-association regression survived it. Reading the model
 * cell and the share cell out of the same <tr> is what makes a mismatch a
 * mismatch.
 *
 * Only <tr>, data-label and each cell's visible text are assumed. The bar is
 * found by the width it carries rather than by its class or attribute order,
 * and the printed number is whatever the cell shows once its tags are gone, so
 * a presentation-only change is not reported as a regression.
 *
 * The dashboard is loaded from the file next to this test, so the assertions
 * run against the shipped code, not a copy of it.
 *
 * Requires node (no other dependency); the rest of the suite is Python only.
 *
